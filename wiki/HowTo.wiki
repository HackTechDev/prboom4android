#summary PrBoom4Android Instructions

= Introduction =

PrBoom4Android is a port of the open source PrBoom Doom engine.  It was originally ported to android by Vladimir Silva when the first android device, the G1, was released.  Since the original port was designed to work with the G1's hardware keyboard, it did not function with touchscreen only devices.  This release adds on-screen multitouch controls to support newer devices.  If you have a hardware keyboard, you can always use that or enable the touch controls, the choice is your!


= Getting Started =

When you first launch PrBoom4Android you'll be greeted with the main user interface.<br>
This is the main android interface to the PrBoom engine.

== Basic Requirements ==
  * First you need to get your hands on a WAD to play.
   * Because the original Doom and Doom II wads are copyrighted material, you will have to own those games and grab the .WAD files from your copy(s).  Once you have you .WAD file(s) copy them to your SD card in a folder named "Doom".  For you linux guys that's /sdcard/Doom.
   * If you do not own these games, don't worry because there is FreeDoom, a free doom .WAD, that you can download directly from PrBoom4Android.  Just click on the Install WADs button.

  * Second thing you need, although this is optional, are the sounds for the game.  Due to the implementation of this port, the sounds are not extracted from the .WAD files at runtime.  This is on the list of things to do, but in the meantime, this is the workaround.
   * To download and install the sounds, click on the "Install Sounds" button (tricky huh?).  You should something similar to the following image while the sounds download.

== Time to Play! ==
Now that you've got the necessary game files loaded up, it's time to play!  If you have multiple .WAD files installed on your SD card, you will want to choose which WAD to play.  To select a .WAD to play, press the drop down selector below "Choose WAD to play"

Once you've selected the .WAD to play, feel free to enable or disable some of the Game Engine Options.  
 * Fullscreen  - this option uses the majority of your device's screen, but may also run a bit slower due to the higher resolution.  If the game seems to be a bit choppy, see how it runs when disabling this feature.
 * Enable Sound - What good is a game without sound?  Not much, but if you don't care for the sound or are somewhere you don't want to be heard then disable this feature.
 * On-Screen Controls - Toggles the on-screen controls.  Most newer devices do not have a hardware keyboard so playing doom on them isn't possible without using the on-screen controls.


=== The Controls ===

The controls are as follows from bottom left going counter-clockwise
 * D-Pad - Moves you forward, backward, and strafes left and right.
 * Use/Open - Opens doors and activates switches.
 * Run - When this is checked you will move faster through the level
 * Turn - This left/right pad turns you left and right.
 * Y/N - Simple yes and no buttons for those times the game asks you a yes or no question.
 * 1-9 - Allows you to switch between the available weapons you have on hand.
 * Map - Press this to toggle the on-screen map on and off
 * D-Pad indicator - This indicator shows you what part of the D-Pad is being pressed.  This is helpful for those that have a larger thumb and can't see what part of the D-Pad they are pressing.
 * Fire/Enter - Pressing anywhere else on the screen will either fire your weapon, or act as the enter key for selecting menu items.

In addition to the onscreen controls, some of your devices buttons also serve a purpose.
 * Menu Button - Press this to toggle the main android screen on and off.  This is useful for toggling the on-screen controls while playing or to quit the game.
 * Back Button - This will toggle the in-game menu.  In order to select a new game, or save/load a previous game you will need to press this to get going.  To select an item on the in-screen menu, just press anywhere on the screen that does not contain a button.
